### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 443eb9#C, a developer who is constantly striving for improvement from China.

<hr>

*What does my name actually means?*
- 443eb9 is a random color I picked in Photoshop. I chose it from so many colors, so I feel like we have a connection.
- #C is the reverse representation of C#, which was my favorite language when I was a Unity developer. Also, "#" acts like a separator.

Currently, Rust ðŸ¦€ is my favorite language. It runs fast, memory safe, and easy to write. Rust macros, enums, and iterators are the best things ever! C# is my second favorite language. It runs not that fast, but it's even easier to write.

I want to be a full stack open-source game developer in the future. So besides coding, I'm also learning painting, and *planning* to learn cloth/building designing, and music composition.
